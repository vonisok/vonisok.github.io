# Python Web Cloner

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create a simple web cloner using Python. A web cloner copies the contents of a webpage, allowing you to save it for offline use. We'll use Python's requests library to fetch the webpage and BeautifulSoup from bs4 to parse the HTML content.
Prerequisites

Before we start, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the following libraries if you haven't already:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Step 1: Fetching the Webpage

    First, we need to fetch the content of the webpage we want to clone. We'll use the requests library for this purpose.

```python
import requests

url = 'http://example.com'
response = requests.get(url)

# Ensure the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    html_content = response.text
else:
    print('Failed to retrieve the webpage')
    html_content = ''
```

### Step 2: Parsing the HTML Content

Next, we'll use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML content we fetched. This step allows us to manipulate or access different parts of the webpage as needed.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Parse the HTML content
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

# For demonstration, let's print the title of the webpage
print(soup.title.text)
```

### Step 3: Saving the Webpage Locally

Finally, let's save the webpage to a local file. You might want to enhance this step by also downloading resources like images or CSS for a complete offline experience.

```python
# Define the output file name
output_file = 'cloned_webpage.html'

# Write the HTML content to a file
with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    file.write(soup.prettify())

print(f'Webpage cloned successfully as {output_file}')
```

### Conclusion

You've just created a basic web cloner using Python! This script fetches the webpage, parses its HTML, and saves it locally. Remember, this example is quite basic. Real-world scenarios might require handling JavaScript-rendered content, dealing with pagination, or cloning entire websites, which can be significantly more complex.

Please remember to use web cloning responsibly and ethically. Always check a website's robots.txt file and adhere to its terms of service.
